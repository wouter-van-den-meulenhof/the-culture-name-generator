# The Culture - CI Name Generator

This repository contains a love letter to Iain Banks and his Culture novels.

As a cloud engineer I sometimes have to deploy or spin up a lot of resources for
testing purposes. This script allows one to at least assign them fun names,
derived from the names Iain Banks would give to ships utilized by The Culture
over the course of his novels.

## Usage

```bash
    cd the-culture-ci-name-generator/src
    python3 ./main.py \
        --count 10 \
        --format json
```
